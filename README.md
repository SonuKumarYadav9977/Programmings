# 📚 Programmings

Welcome to **Programmings** — a collection of code snippets, mini-projects, and experiments from my programming journey 💻✨

> 🧠 This repo is **open source** — feel free to explore, learn, fork, and contribute!

## 📌 What's Inside?

A growing archive of programs I've written while learning and experimenting with different languages.  
You’ll find code in:

- 🟣 C++
- 🐍 Python
- 🌐 HTML/CSS
- ☕ Java (maybe?)
- 🧬 A bit of Assembly (if you’re brave 😉)
- And whatever I dive into next...

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This isn’t production-grade code — it’s my **learning playground**, where:
- I break stuff 🔨
- I fix stuff 🛠️
- I level up 💪

---

## 🤝 Want to Contribute?

Sure! Just follow the vibe:
1. Keep code clean 🧼
2. Comment where needed 🗣️
3. No spam, no forks of forks of forks 🍴

Fork → Code → PR → Celebrate 🎉

## 💬 Feedback?

Open an issue or drop a star ⭐ if you found something useful, confusing, or just weirdly impressive 😅

> Made with curiosity, late-night energy, and a C++ compiler that *sometimes* behaves 😎
